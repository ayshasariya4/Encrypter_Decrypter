# Encrypter_Decrypter
Developed an Encrypter and Decrypter application using multiple cipher algorithms, including Caesar, Vigenère, Playfair, and Rail Fence. The system allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages through different cipher techniques with a user-friendly interface for real-time demonstration.
Key Responsibilities:
•	Developed JavaScript functions for encryption and decryption using Caesar, Vigenère, Playfair, and  Rail Fence ciphers.
•	Implemented shift-based and polyalphabetic encryption logic to handle various cipher methods.
•	Integrated real-time message encryption and decryption with dynamic selection of algorithms in the  user interface.
